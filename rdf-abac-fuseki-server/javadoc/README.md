# RDF-ABAC plus Apache Jena Fuseki

This module serves only to generate an Uber JAR that can be used as a drop-in replacement for the official Apache Jena
Fuseki Uber JAR.  It adds all the additional dependencies necessary to configure an RDF ABAC protected dataset and 
is intended for user experimentation with this repositories' functionality.
