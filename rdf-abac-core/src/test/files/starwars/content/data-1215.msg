<https://starwars.com#planet_NewBakstre> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "New Bakstre was a planet located within the Tendrannan subsector of the Outer Rim's New Territories. Part of the loosely affiliated domain known as the Cassandran Worlds, New Bakstre was a planet dominated by industry situated on the important Braxant Run hyperlane that served much of the galaxy's northern quadrant. One of New Bakstre's major settlements, Havridam City, was partially destroyed in 22 BBY after activists from the Mechanical Liberation Front accidentally detonated a shipment of Vindicator XM-15 'brilliant' missiles. The planet was involved in the later stages of the Clone Wars when Jedi-led Galactic Republic forces engaged the military of the Confederacy of Independent Systems on the world's surface. Annexed by the Galactic Empire along with the entirety of the Cassandran Worlds roughly twenty years later, New Bakstre remained under Imperial control during the Galactic Civil War and the Second Galactic Civil War, with a brief intermediate spell, during which it was allied with the New Republic. New Bakstre possessed seven moons, a rapid rotation rate, and a sky that was colored purple. " .
