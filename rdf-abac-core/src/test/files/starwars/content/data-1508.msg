Ronyards was a common dumping ground for obsolete, inoperative and unwanted droids, and was covered in metal piles that could reach up to five miles deep. Ronyards was home to a large population of active droids who worshipped Ronyards itselfâ€”and their 'living god' was known to defend its inhabitants when they were threatened by outsiders. " .
