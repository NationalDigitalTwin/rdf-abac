<https://starwars.com#planet_Skeebo> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Fett discovered that the Skeebo City Konstabulary Kaptain Voor was collaborating with the Skavers and forced the corrupt officer to lead him to the criminals' hidden base. In the meantime, the Herglic Ry-Kooda, who was seeking vengeance on Fett, Gorga, and Orko for the death of his brother, Bar-Kooda, attacked Orko's starship while it was arriving on Skeebo. Skavers accidentally shot Ry-Kooda's ship down, although the nigh-invulnerable Herglic merely proceeded to commandeer one of the criminals' trucks in order to travel to a confrontation with Fett at the Skavers' hideout. There, Fett liberated Anachro from imprisonment, only to run into Ry-Kooda at the entrance to a cavern. During the ensuing brawl, Fett caused the cave to collapse on top of Ry-Kooda, which led him to incorrectly assume that the Herglic had been killed. The bounty hunter then returned Anachro to her family, and the newly-wed Hutts soon returned to their home on the planet Tatooine. " .
