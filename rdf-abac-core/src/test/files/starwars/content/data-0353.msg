It shared its name with the Chaf family, one of the Nine Ruling Families of the Chiss Ascendancy. The communications triad of Colonial Station Chaf was used for relaying communication through to the Xodlak family task force led by Senior Captain Xodlak'in'daro on their way to the planet Hoxim. The battle fleet of the Kilji religious species used a long-range triad transmitter located on Colonal Station Chaf while they conquered several nations near the Chiss world to communicate with their leader, Generalirius Nakirre. Once the generals stopped communicating with Nakirre, he feared the generals of the Kilhorde had extended their conquests to the Chiss world, however, that was not what had happened, instead, the Paataatus species had sent a Paataatus attack fleet to destroy the Kilhorde.
