<https://starwars.com#planet_KharDelba> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Khar Delba was an icy, snowy planet in the Sith Worlds, which was part of the Sith Empire as of 5000 BBY. Khar Delba had one moon, Khar Shian, and was located at the edge of Sith Space. It was the home to the Sith war behemoth. Naga Sadow placed a citadel there, but unbeknownst to the rest of the Sith at large, Sadow's Khar Delba citadel was a mere decoy; his real base was on Khar Shian. In 5000 BBY, with Naga Sadow in the midst of a power struggle with his rival, Ludo Kressh, Khar Delba was attacked from orbit by forces loyal to Kressh. Although the citadel was badly damaged in Kressh's orbital bombardment of the planet, Sadow emerged victorious after calling in his secret fleet from the far side of Khar Shian to counterattack Kressh. In the following months, Khar Delba was rebuilt and was established as the center of Naga Sadow's power as he gathered a force to invade the Galactic Republic, in a conflict that became known as the Great Hyperspace War.
