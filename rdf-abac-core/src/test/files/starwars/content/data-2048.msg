The facility housed the generator that powered the SLD-26 planetary shield generator protecting the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station, which was being constructed in orbit of the forest moon. The base was guarded by a garrison of stormtroopers, scout troopers, Imperial Navy Troopers and other Imperial officers, along with a complement of All Terrain Scout Transports and All Terrain Armored Transports. During the Battle of Endor, an Alliance strike team led by General Han Solo infiltrated the bunker that housed the Imperial shield facility and destroyed it. This lowered the shields on the orbiting Death Star, allowing the Alliance Fleet to destroy the battle station." .

The secret Imperial training facility on Daro, which was hidden inside of a mountain, had its thermal exhaust port as one of only two potential exits out of the base, although the sheer drop outside the port made it an unwise prospect without flying transportation. Famously, the Death Star space station had two such ports, a main port and a smaller one which led directly to its reactor, which had been deliberately designed by Galen Erso as an act of sabotage to give the station a critical vulnerability. During the Battle of Yavin, Luke Skywalker fired two proton torpedoes into the exhaust port with the aid of the Force, leading to the destruction of the battle station." .

Following the Battle of Yavin, the Alliance evacuated the Great Temple and within three years, built and populated a new base of operations on the snow planet Hoth." .

Commanded by an unofficial triumvirate of General Armitage Hux, Kylo Ren, and Captain Phasma, it was armed with a superweapon capable of destroying entire star systems halfway across the galaxy. The First Order viewed this ability as an evolution of the planet-destroying capabilities of the Galactic Empire's Death Star designs, with the weapon serving as the ultimate culmination of old Imperial research into dark energy translations and hyperspace tunneling." .

A larger and more powerful Death Star, the second Death Star's long-term purpose was similar to the first: to terrorize planets and star systems in league with the Rebel Alliance through the use of its planet-destroying superlaser. However, the Death Star II also served another purpose: luring the Rebels into a battle that would, the Empire hoped, destroy them once and for all. Though designed in the likeness of its predecessor's appearance and function, the DS-2 Death Star saw a technical improvement through the incorporation of millions of millimeter-sized heat-dispersion tubes in place of the two-meter-wide thermal exhaust port exploited by the Rebel Alliance at the Battle of Yavin." .
