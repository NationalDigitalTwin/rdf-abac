<https://starwars.com#planet_Uphrades> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Uphrades was a planet located in the Uphrades system of the Inner Rim. Originally a green and fertile agriworld during the years leading up to the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire, Uphrades supplied the Republic capital planet of Coruscant with much of its food supplies. This earned it the nickname 'Coruscant's Granary' until the Sith Lord Darth Angral targeted the agriworld during his campaign of vengeance in 3643 BBY. As part of his revenge against the Republic and the Jedi Order for the death of his son, Tarnis, Angral tested the Desolator superweapon on Uphrades and devastated its surface, killing millions and trapping the few hundred survivors on the planet by ionizing its atmosphere. Thanks to the efforts of Doctor Senessa and the crew of the Republic medical frigate Daybreaker, the survivors endured the several months it took for the ion field to dissipate, but the planet itself remained a desolate and barren world.
