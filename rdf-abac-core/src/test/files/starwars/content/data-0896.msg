Using Alanciar's abundant resources and industrial base, the Sith were able to build a fleet of wooden sailing vessels which enabled them to explore and conquer the other landmasses and seas of Kesh particularly in the unexplored northern hemisphere. By 2974 BBY, the Sith discovered the southern polar continent of Eshkrene and the Doomed. That same year, the ancient Sith Lord Remulus Dreypa was also killed in an brief outbreak of violence. In 41 ABY, the Lost Tribe rediscovered interstellar travel when an ancient Sith Meditation Sphere known as Ship landed on the planet and allied itself with the Tribe. The Tribe then assembled a Sith armada and sought to expand into the galaxy. This put them into contact and conflict with both the New Jedi Order and a powerful entity known as Abeloth. " .
