The battle was preceded by years of attacks by the fledgling Rebel Alliance against the Empire and began the five-year period in which the Alliance successfully fought to replace the Galactic Empire with the New Republic." .

<https://starwars.com#operationalevent_OperationStarlight> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Operation Starlight was a Rebel Alliance mission, the objective of which was to reassemble the Alliance Fleet after its scatter following the Battle of Hoth. But every attempt to reassemble the fleet put the Rebellion at the mercy of the Empire because they became able to crack the rebel transmissions and destroy the rebel divisions. So the Alliance looked to new uncracked codes to bring together the fleet. Commander Grek of the Fourth Division derived the plan's name from the Starlight Beacon, a navigational station that had been constructed in the High Republic Era." .
<https://starwars.com#militaryengagement_BattleOfExegol> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The Battle of Exegol was the decisive final battle in the war between the First Order and the Resistance in which the Resistance and the Citizens' Fleet defeated the Final Order, the Xyston-class Star Destroyer fleet designed by the Sith Eternal. The Resistance's victory prevented the Star Destroyers from leaving Exegol to reinforce First Order forces and began an uprising against it across the galaxy. The battle was also the final battle of the ancient, millennia-long war between the Jedi and the Sith, ending in a decisive victory for the Jedi with the destruction of Darth Sidious and prevention of the Sith's return as a whole." .

It was applied to the collective military campaigns that the reborn Emperor Palpatine, also known as the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious, launched in an attempt to retake control of the galaxy and took over the Galactic Empire once more. These were essentially wave assaults from Byss and the rest of the Deep Core to support the Galactic Empire renwed campaign." .

The battle was an Imperial invasion led by Darth Vader, aimed at destroying the Rebel Alliance's Echo Base hidden on the remote ice world Hoth and capturing Luke Skywalker. The base's location was discovered when a Viper probe droid, deployed by Darth Vader's Death Squadron randomly landed on Hoth, convincing the Rebels to begin an evacuation of Hoth." .

<https://starwars.com#operationalevent_OperationMasterstroke> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Operation Masterstroke was an operation planned by the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War against the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Planning for the operation was overseen by Imperial High Command during the time following the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY. The intricacies of the operation were conducted by at least one Imperial representative who contracted the services of couriers to receive multiple cargo shipments from agents of the Imperial Security Bureau. These efforts resulted in the stockpiling of immense amounts of material, including proton torpedo warheads, heavy weapon stabilizing mounts, capacitor banks, and drilling pumps. The Imperial higher-ups believed that the success of Operation Masterstroke would paralyze the Rebellion in a single unexpected blow. However, the operation was apparently beset with delays. ISB workers responsible for delivering the shipments lightly criticized the Empire for taking so long to complete the operation, and they wondered when it would even occur." .

Operation Skyhook would become one of the most devastating series of battles of the war. The entire population of the Alliance-allied planet Alderaan would be wiped out by the superlaser of the Death Star. During the Battle of Yavin, the Death Star was destroyed by a lucky shot by Luke Skywalker, wiping out hundreds of thousands of Imperial personnel, including Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin." .

During the waning months of the conflict, Counselor Gallius Rax assumed control of the Galactic Empire and concentrated much of its remaining forces on Jakku, an Inner Rim desert world where the Empire would make its last standoff against the New Republic." .

The triumph of the Alliance over the Empire, and the void left in the wake of the Emperor's demise, gave the Alliance the opportunity to give rise to the New Republic, which ultimately prevailed over the Empire in the Battle of Jakku one year later. The legacy of the Battle of Endor reverberated for decades after the fighting ended, including into the brewing war between the Imperial-inspired First Order and the Resistance that arose to combat it." .
