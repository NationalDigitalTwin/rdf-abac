The planet was connected to the worlds of Tisht and Varl by the hyperlane called The Dead Road, while the Elgitâ€“M'Hanna Corridor linked M'Hanna to the planet of Sakifwanna. M'Hanna was a world of black dust that was scoured by supersonic winds, and its history was the subject of various rumors and legends. " .
