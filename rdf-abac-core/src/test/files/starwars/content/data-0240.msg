Bothawui was considered to be strategically important during the Clone Wars, leading to it being the site of a battle between Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and General Grievous that halted a Separatist advance. Later in the war, around the time the Galactic Republic suffered a loss on Ryloth, Bothawui hosted another battle, though this engagement ended with many Republic losses. " .
