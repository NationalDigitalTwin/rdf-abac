<https://starwars.com#planet_Rothana> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Rothana was an ice planet located in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories. 800 years before the Battle of Yavin, the planet was sold to the starship manufacturer Kuat Drive Yards, leading to the establishment of Rothana Heavy Engineering as a subsidiary. It was home to shipyards controlled by the Galactic Empire. In 14 BBY, ships stationed at Rothana were deployed by the Imperial Navy to other locations that were considered to be potential targets of Berch Teller and his rebel group. After the start of Operation Ringbreaker, General Crix Madine of the Rebellion designated it as a high-priority target with high security level on a galactic map included in The Rebel Files, a top-secret dossier of sensitive information vital to the Rebellion. The Empire largely abandoned their shipyards in preparation for the Battle of Jakku near the end of the Galactic Civil War, allowing a group of pro-Imperial sympathizers to attempt to steal the craft a year later.
